“Stock Advisory”


Introduction

We are a Stock Advisory Group looking to forecast the next big stock opportunities for our clients that are under $100 a share. This simulates from information from the end of December 2015 (12/31/15)  for recommendation. To reach this conclusion, we research the criteria for selecting stocks based on this range. We took the criteria and narrowed it down for what we felt are the essential 6 areas to reach this conclusion. Based on a priority ranking created, we cross reference the top 5  selected stocks  and run them to today’s stock results to conclude if they were successful recommendations.

Questions & Data

We first pulled that Final Closing Ticker for the end of 2015 (12-31-2015) all stock criteria inclusive. Based on this data pulled, we narrowed the stock criteria down to a core set to evaluate the stocks. We created, cleaned and merged data to .csv & into a central folder to retrieve from. 

Cleaning Our Dataset

The project was broken down over 5 Notebooks to reach our conclusion and results.
	-Cleaning/Merging of Data: pulled from our data folder (.csv)
	-Picking Stocks: calculated by our weighted ranking system
	-Investment Distribution: calculated from the recommended stock     values by strength.	
	-Stock Analysis: breaks down the individually selected stocks 
	-Api Call for Current Stock Prices: to call for the current closing prices of the selected stocks for comparison and well as Return on Investment (ROI) results.
